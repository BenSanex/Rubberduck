About Rubberduck
================

Rubberduck is an on demand mentoring service.  Students can request help with coding problems and meet up with any online mentor in a virtual classroom with code sharing and video chat technologies.

We've utilized the pre-release of Rails 5 for the technology that matches students with their mentors and alerts when questions are available to be answered.
